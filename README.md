# Stained Glass

Stained Glass by Kent Brewster ([@kentbrew](https://github.com/kentbrew))

> Stained Glass was the inspiration for Nick Schlott's Tesserae, which came out in 1991 for Macs, DOS, Nintendo, and many other platforms. You'll need a PC with DOS 2.1 or later, 256k RAM, and 75k free space on your hard disk to run Stained Glass, and anything running Windows for Tesserae.
